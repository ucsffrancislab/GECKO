#	CCLS C4 RUN

Nextflow uses a Java VM so needs to be from a non-login node ...


```BASH
cd ~/github/ucsffrancislab/GECKO/ImportMatrix
#/bin/rm -rf ccls_import/ work/ results/

./main.pl decomposition --outdir ccls_import -B --reads '../CCLS/*bam' --kmersize 20 -resume
```

Takes quite a while. 

Then cleanup.


```
rm work/* -rf
```



```
find ccls_import -type f -exec chmod a-w {} \;

./main.pl importation --groupconfig ../CCLS/microRNA_demo.conf --outdir ccls_import -resume

./main.pl discretization --matrix ccls_import/rawimport/matrix/RAWmatrix.matrix â€“-outdir ccls_import
```

The above does not put the output in `ccls_import`.
Initially it had `-outdir` and not `--outdir`, but that wasn't the problem.
Not sure what's special about it.


```
mv results/discretization ccls_import/
```

This takes FOREVER! Set to 299 hours and still doesn't finish.
Only uses 1 CPU at about 15%.

Need to add shebang line to multipleGeckoStart.py
Also chmod +x multipleGeckoStart.py

If sbatch is run from a login node, GA_sbatch.sh will silently fail.
Not entirely clear why, but think because something isn't loaded and not clear which just yet.
Will investigate.
Likely openmpi
Also need the "SBATCH --export=NONE" line.

```
cd ~/github/ucsffrancislab/GECKO/Gecko/algoGen

/bin/rm -rf ../../Demo/DemoGeneticAlgResultDir/ slurm-?????.out GECKO_?????.* __pycache__/ plot_analysis_?????.* 

sbatch multipleGeckoStart.py ../../Demo/configGA_microRNA_demo.conf 20
```

Job is submitted. Waiting ...
